# Moon-Notes
WebSite - https://palakbaghel.github.io/Moon-Notes/

In this website you can add notes as well as delete notes and you donâ€™t
need to remember anything. This website consists of an animated
background and attractive UI design.
Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and
because they are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever
could.
